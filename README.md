# BarCodeScanner
POC barcode scanner functionality for Epi Info

This repo is a proof-of-concept to add a barcode scanner to Epi Info.

A user will have the ability to use a barcode scanner (both 1d and 2d) to read a barcode/QRCode and add the information into an Epi Info form.

Because not all users will have ability to acquire an actual barcode scanner, a webcam can be used in its place.

Until an actual scanner is acquired by this dev, the repo only has webcam capabilities at the moment.

Updates will follow once a scanner is acquired.
